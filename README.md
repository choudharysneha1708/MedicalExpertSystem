# MedicalExpertSystem
Welcome to the Medical Expert System project for disease prediction! This system is an interactive tool designed to assist in predicting diseases based on provided medical symptoms using Python and pandas library.
# Overview
This system utilizes a dataset (Data.csv) containing information about various diseases and their corresponding symptoms. The primary file MedicalExpertSystem.ipymb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the Medical Expert System.
## Code Overview
****Loading Dataset:**** The system loads the dataset (Data.csv) using Pandas to extract disease-symptom relations.
**Symptom Selection**: The user interface prompts questions regarding symptoms to identify potential diseases based on selected symptoms.
****Probability Calculation****: The system calculates the probabilities of potential diseases based on selected symptoms.
**Level of COVID-19 Assessment**: If relevant symptoms are selected, the system provides an assessment of the likelihood of having COVID-19 and suggests potential medications and supplements.
